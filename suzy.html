<h2>The Original War Horse!</h2>
<p>I bought Suzy back in 2007 from a guy who was going through a really rough time. The housing market had collapsed and he was upside dowin in his morgage, trying to avoid losing his house. Unfortunately for him, his wife forced him to sell the 1999 Suzuki Intruder VL1500. I met him in a dreary Ohio day, and saw this gorgeous bike that was barely broken in- she had less than 5,000 miles on the odometer that day. And he was asking for $2,000. I took her for a ride and we bonded pretty much instantly. As I rounded the last corner into the man's neighborhood, I knew I had to have her but his price was unacceptable- the blue book was almost $5,000 at the time and he clearly had no clue what he was doing. I pulled 40 $100 bills out of my vest pocket and explained my offer to him, to which he replied that he was glad she was going home with someone honest. Suzy has been left in the stable since Lozen came about, but only because she needs some work and I just haven't made the time to make her whole again. But as she sits today, there's more than 58,000 miles on that bike and I love her just as much today as I did the first time I rode her. Here's the skinny on Suzy:</p>
