Thanks to some of the adventures I've been getting to take, and the motivation of some folks around the world, I though it would be fun to share some of the fun with you. I'll be posting some stuff here, as well as building a new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvAAwLc11f4EUAAhSuLK5pw"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/unbound_nomad/"&gt;Instagram page&lt;/a&gt;, to show how I tackle preparing for some of what life throws at me. &lt;/p&gt;

Until then, keep your knees in the breeze!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Motorcycles"></category><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry></feed>
