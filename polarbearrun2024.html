Are you ready to rev up, gear up, and go beyond the chill? Let's dive into the details and get set for a ride like no other!</p>
<h2>The Beginning: How it All Started</h2>
<p>The Polar Bear Run has been an annual tradition for nearly 2 decades. What started out as cousins who were too crazy stay inside for the winter, evolved. Eventually, cousins became motorcycle club Brothers, and the tradition expanded into a large-scale gathering for the club the cousins rode with, spreading from these two knuckleheads to hundreds of frosty bikers all over the country. The passion for motorcycles well outweighed the temperatures, and many times we were known to ski bikes out of the neighborhoods to make the run because snowplows hadn't yet come. This tradition has been adopted by The Unbound Nomad and has returned to the roots of a small event. But it's time to start sharing it as we build this community and encourage other all-weather riders to join the adventure!</p>
<p>There were not many photos taken in the years leading up to this year's event, but we're excited for that to change. As we strive to build this community, we encourage photos, video, and publication of all sorts before, during, and after the event. In fact, we're working with some vendors to come up with prizes for contests to help motivate participants to post their experiences and help raise awareness for The Polar Bear Run and The Unbound Nomad community.</p>
<p>With each passing year and each evolution of the event, it becomes clearer that The Polar Bear Run is more than just a ride—it's a manifestation of a deep love for motorcycles and a commitment to sharing that passion with the riding community.</p>
<h2>Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance</h2>
<p>The success of your Polar Bear Run adventure lies in meticulous preparation. As the icy winds swirl around you, being winter-ready becomes the linchpin of an enjoyable and safe ride. In this section, we'll navigate through essential tips that have developed over the many years of the event.</p>
<h3>Gear Inspection:</h3>
<p>Before you hit the frosty roads, ensure your gear is up to the challenge!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helmet:</strong> Confirm it's undamaged, compliant with safety standards, and that all pieces/parts are in good working order. Helmets are not required in Ohio, but highly encouraged on a group ride in potentially inclement weather.</li>
<li><strong>Gloves:</strong> Inspect for wear, tears, or damage. Check the seams and any velcro, buttons, straps, or other mechanisms used to tighten and secure them to your hands. If you use glove liners, make sure you have an extra set.</li>
<li><strong>Jacket and Pants:</strong> Verify the outfit you choose provides ample protection against the cold and wind. More about this in the "Weather-Appropriate Clothing" section below.</li>
<li><strong>Boots:</strong> Riding boots are not required but highly encouraged. Full foot coverage is required, and sandals, flip-flops, or anything else deemed unsafe by The Unbound Nomad will be cause for refusal to ride. Ensure footwear is sturdy and suitable for cold-weather riding.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Motorcycle Inspection:</h3>
<p>The Unbound Nomad will visually inspect all motorcycles at the time of check-in. Any machine deemed unsafe will be revised entry. A thorough check of your trusty steed is crucial for a trouble-free journey Before you take off to join the rendezvous, here are some things you should check:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lights:</strong> Confirm all lights are operational—headlights, taillights, brake lights, and turn signals.</li>
<li><strong>Tires:</strong> Inspect front and rear tires for proper inflation, tread depth, and visible damage. Now, a lot of these fancy new motorcycles have pressure monitoring systems installed, but it is highly recommended you put a pressure gauge to the valve stem and check it manually.</li>
<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Test both front and rear brakes for responsiveness. Also, this is a good time to remind people that braking doesn't ONLY depend on brakes. Your speed, weather and road conditions, and other environmental variables play a big part in stopping a motorcycle. As you prepare for the event, be mindful of the fact, and the factors involved.</li>
<li><strong>Fluid Levels:</strong> Fair weather riders may have winterized their machines by this time of year, but be sure to check oil, brake fluid, coolant, and other essential fluid levels as you prepare yours for the fun.</li>
<li><strong>Controls:</strong> A standard part of the routine maintenance of any motorcycle, you need to be sure the thing can stop and go as expected. Ensure throttle, clutch, and brake mechanisms operate seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weather Check:</h3>
<p>Be prepared for whatever nature throws your way. The Unbound Nomad will be posting daily weather predictions for the event, but participants are encouraged to check the weather conditions themselves and to adjust preparations accordingly. If it is too cold or too wet, or if any other weather conditions develop that make you uncomfortable - stay home! The event is free. You lose nothing. You have nothing to prove to anyone. Just because we might be insane, doesn't mean you have to be! 
Rain or shine, the ride will go on. The only factor leading to cancellation is a snow emergency. Follow The Unbound Nomad on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unbound_nomad/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://x.com/unbound_nomad">Twitter/X</a> for details and decisions on the day of the event.</p>
<h3>Weather-Appropriate Clothing:</h3>
<p>Prepare for changing weather conditions with layered clothing. Cold weather riding is exhilarating. But it can be miserable if you're not properly prepared. At 50MPH, the average speed you'll ride during The Polar Bear Run 2024, we're expecting wind chills between 19-26 degrees. So dress in layers, and leave yourself options to accommodate temperature fluctuations.
Equip yourself with cold-weather gear from KemiMoto, like the awesome <a href="https://amzn.to/48mfhlq">heated gloves</a>, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3RJb3yL">heated vest</a> which goes great under a leather jacket, or keep your buns warm with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3tewRJg">heated pants</a>. This is my second winter with my heated gear, and I absolutely love staying warm while enjoying a cold day on the road!</p>
<h3>Emergency Kit:</h3>
<p>Be ready for any unexpected surprises. A basic emergency kit is something you should have on you anyway, but if you're considering riding in potentially inclement weather with strangers whose skill and proficiency are unknown, this is even more important. At all times, a motorcycle should be carrying a first aid kit, a tire repair kit, and essential tools for field repairs of the bike. Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni5b0QgKU0c">YouTube video</a> that profiles the kit I keep in my saddlebag, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWgktJwL7g">this video</a> profiles the kit I keep on my person.
Also, keep emergency contact information readily available.</p>
<h3>Tire and Suspension Check:</h3>
<p>Another aspect of routine motorcycle maintenance, be sure to inspect your tires for proper inflation and damage leading up to the ride. And remember to check the suspension for smooth operation.</p>
<h3>Fuel Level:</h3>
<p>Ensure you have a full tank before embarking on the ride. The departure point is The Flying J Travel Plaza, so arrive early to top off your tank if needed! And while Flying J isn't an official sponsor of The Polar Bear Run 2024, they are kind enough to let us use the semi-truck parking area for staging the pack for the ride. So get some fuel, buy a snack, or get a cup of coffee before the ride to say thank you!
<em>P.S. Dear Flying J, if you're interested in being a sponsor, we'd love to hear from you!</em></p>
<h3>Navigation and Route Planning:</h3>
<p>The ride will be guided, and navigation shouldn't be of concern, and we will be taking measures to keep the pack together through any stop signs or traffic lights that we encounter. But participants should familiarize themselves with the planned route, noting potential stops and hazards.
Route details will be covered during the pre-ride safety brief.</p>
<h3>Communication Devices:</h3>
<p>Stay Connected with Your Fellow Riders! Helmet-mounted communication devices are a great way to keep the pack connected. Ensure your Bluetooth communication system is charged, and we'll work on pairing riders with comms before the group embarks. Please make sure to state what make/model of system you have when you check in for the ride!</p>
<h3>Group Riding Etiquette:</h3>
<p>A riding order will be established during the pre-ride safety briefing. We will be using turn signals during The Polar Bear Run 2024, but hand signals will also be used to communicate during the event. Additionally, voice communications will be available for those who have Bluetooth communications and pair with the group before the ride departs. Follow @unbound_nomad on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unbound_nomad/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://x.com/unbound_nomad">Twitter/X</a> for updates and details.</p>
<p><img alt="Hand Signals" src="/images/handsignals.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" width="50%"></p>
<h3>Documentation: Have Your Paperwork in Order</h3>

<p>Carry necessary documents such as your driver's license, motorcycle registration, and insurance.</p>
<h3>Final Systems Check: Before the Kickstands Go Up</h3>

<p>Start your motorcycle and listen for any unusual sounds.
Test all controls, including throttle, brakes, and clutch.</p>
<p>Now, with your checklist complete, you're ready to face the cold winds and embark on The Polar Bear Run 2024. The adventure awaits!</p>
