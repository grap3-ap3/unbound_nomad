      I’ve been riding for more than two decades. Long days on the road, miles of quiet thinking, and the kind of freedom that doesn’t fit neatly into anyone’s expectations — that’s where this brand was born.
    </p>

    <p>
      I built <em>The Unbound Nomad</em> because riding has never just been about getting from Point A to Point B.
      It’s about the stories you collect, the strangers who become friends, the roads you never forget, and the feeling of rolling into a place you’ve never been and thinking:
      <br><br>
      <em>Yeah… this is exactly where I was supposed to be.</em>

## The Accident That Changed Everything

In June of 2025, I had my first motorcycle accident in 23 years.

One moment I was doing what I love.  
The next, I was on the pavement — injured, sidelined, and watching an entire season slip away.

I couldn’t ride.  
I couldn’t travel.  
And The Unbound Nomad — everything I’d been building — came to a full stop.

But riders don’t stay down.  
We rebuild.  
We find a new line through the curve.

The accident forced me to rethink what this brand truly meant.  
And what I came back to was simple:

**Meaningful rides. Real experiences. Roads worth remembering.**

             alt="Accident Damage Image 2"
             style="width:300px; height:200px; object-fit:cover; border-radius:6px; display:block; margin:0 auto; float:none !important;">

## The 2026 Pivot: Ride More. Plan Less.

2026 marks a focused relaunch of The Unbound Nomad — one built around clarity, simplicity, and purpose.

Two offerings now define the brand:

### → Micro-Adventures (Single-Day Guided Rides)

Curated scenic rides built for riders who want to show up, twist the throttle, and make a memory — without spending hours researching roads.

### → Concierge Trip Planning (Full-Service Ride Planning)

Multi-day custom itineraries crafted around your goals, pace, skill level, and preferred riding style.  
Routes, pacing, stops, GPX files — all designed with the care of someone who’s ridden the miles himself.

---

## Why I Do This

Because I know what motorcycling gives people:

Clarity. Confidence. Peace. Adrenaline. Connection.  
Stories that stay with you for years.

I also know how much time riders waste trying to plan the “perfect ride,” only to second-guess themselves the whole time.

This brand exists to fix that.

I design rides with intention and experience — not algorithms.  
Rides that feel good in the moment and even better in hindsight.  
Rides built to be remembered.

## The Road Ahead

I’m back on my feet, rebuilding, and riding into 2026 with more purpose than ever.

If you’re ready to experience the road without the stress…  
If you want a ride that’s crafted, not copied…  
If you want to actually *feel* like a nomad for a day or a week…

Then saddle up.

Let’s make 2026 the year you stop dreaming about the perfect ride — and go take it.
