Welcome to the new site! Thanks to some of the adventures I've been getting to take, and the motivation of some folks around the world, I though it would be fun to share some of the fun with you. I'll be posting some stuff here, as well as building a new [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvAAwLc11f4EUAAhSuLK5pw) and [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/unbound_nomad/), to show how I tackle preparing for some of what life throws at me. 

For now, this is just the first post to launch the new site. But stay tuned, and check back soon for more! Until then, keep your knees in the breeze!
