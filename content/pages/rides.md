# 2026 Micro-Adventures & Guided Rides

In previous years, The Unbound Nomad focused on a fixed annual ride calendar.  
For 2026 and beyond, the focus shifts to **flexible, high-quality single-day guided rides** that are built around you.

Instead of cramming everything into one rigid schedule, Micro-Adventures are offered on select dates throughout the riding season, with options for:

- **Open group rides** – join other riders on curated routes  
- **Private group rides** – reserve the day for your club, friends, or organization

## What to Expect on a Micro-Adventure

Every ride is designed to feel intentional — not thrown together the night before.

- Professionally curated scenic routes  
- Group ride briefing and safety overview  
- Smart pacing designed for enjoyment, not punishment  
- Fuel and food stops built into the plan  
- Scenic photo stops and storytelling along the way  

You show up with a full tank. I handle the rest.

## Book a Ride or Reserve a Date

If you see a month or region that gets your attention — or you want to reserve a **Private Group Ride** before dates fill up:

When you reach out, it helps to include:

- Whether you’re looking for an **open ride** or a **private group**  
- Approximate number of riders  
- Any must-see roads or general preferences (pace, scenery, mileage)  

From there, I’ll help you dial in the right ride and lock in your spot.
