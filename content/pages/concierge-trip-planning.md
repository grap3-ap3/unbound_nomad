## Why Riders Love This

Planning a motorcycle trip is fun — until it isn’t.

- What route actually has the best curves?  
- Where are the gas gaps?  
- Which roads are construction nightmares this season?  
- Which hotels are bike-friendly (and which aren’t)?  
- How do you avoid tourist traps and ride like a local?  

That’s where I come in.

You bring the idea:  
> “I want to ride **here** around **this time**, with **this many days** and **this kind of vibe**.”

I turn that into a rideable, realistic, dialed-in plan — so you can focus on the part that matters:

**riding.**

## What’s Included

### 🧭 Custom, Rider-Specific Routing

No generic “best of” lists. No one-size-fits-all Google routes.

I build a route based on:

- your experience level  
- your comfort with mileage and technical roads  
- your time window  
- what you actually want to see and feel  

### 📍 Daily Ride Maps

Each day gets a clear structure:

- start point  
- anchor stops  
- fuel windows  
- optional scenic detours  
- target end point  

You always know what’s ahead — and what’s optional.

### 🍽️ Food & Fuel Stops

A great day on the bike can be wrecked by a bad stop plan.

I’ll help you avoid:

- running on fumes in the middle of nowhere  
- eating whatever happens to be at the nearest exit  

Instead, you get:

- realistic fuel windows  
- vetted food suggestions  
- places that feel like part of the experience, not an afterthought  

### 🛏️ Lodging Guidance

Where you end your day matters.

I focus on:

- motorcycle-friendly lodging options  
- safe, visible or secure parking  
- easy morning departures  
- locations that make sense with the next day’s plan  

### 🌦️ Safety & Weather Notes

I’ll call out:

- elevation changes that can affect temperature  
- common weather patterns for your window  
- road types (open plains, mountain passes, tight twisties, etc.)  
- any “this can get sketchy if you’re not prepared” details  

You still ride your own ride — I just help you ride it smarter.

## Who This Is For

Concierge Trip Planning is a great fit if:

- you’re planning your **first big trip** and don’t want to screw it up  
- you’re an experienced rider who just doesn’t have the bandwidth to plan  
- you’re riding into regions you don’t know well  
- you’re bringing a passenger or group and want to reduce unknowns  
- you want your trip to feel “effortless” once the kickstands go up  

If you want a ride that feels intentional — not thrown together — this is for you.
