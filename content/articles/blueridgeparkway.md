# Blue Ridge Parkway Tour

The Blue Ridge Parkway is a National Parkway and All-American Road in the United States, noted for its scenic beauty. The parkway, which is America's longest linear park, runs for 469 miles through 29 counties in Virginia and North Carolina, linking Shenandoah National Park to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
 
This package starts in Rockfish Gap, Virginia, and takes riders along the the parkway to Ravensford, North Carolina. All fuel stops are planned along the way and fuel costs are included in the package, you simply pull up to the pump and fill your tank! Food options are set before the adventure begins which means you don't have to think about where to eat that next meal because it's already been decided! Your lodging and accommodation options are also laid out before the start of your adventure, and The Unbound Nomad provides your party with a complete packing list to take all the wonder and worry out of preparing for the trip!
