All fuel stops are planned along the way and fuel costs are included in the package, you simply pull up to the pump and fill your tank! Food options are set before the adventure begins which means you don't have to think about where to eat that next meal because it's already been decided! Your lodging and accommodation options are also laid out before the start of your adventure, and The Unbound Nomad provides your party with a complete packing list to take all the wonder and worry out of preparing for the trip!</div>
