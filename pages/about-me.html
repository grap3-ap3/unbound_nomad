<p>I've suffered from wanderlust since I was a child. From wandering off in the store when my mom wasn't looking, to taking off the day I got my driver's license, I have had an insatiable urge to see what's around the next corner! In my early 20's I would disappear for months on end in search of the next great adventure. I explored the country with a friend in his beat up Oldsmobile, got int backpacking, and hiking, but it was never enoughâ€¦ And then I found motorcycles! </p>
<p>My first bike was a 1983 BMW R100 RS - an old tricked out cop bike! That was just the tip of the iceberg and soon I was riding bigger, faster, louder bikes for longer distances and it didn't take long before the addiction was clear. Motorcycles became a part of me. I threw myself into the biker world, and eventually started hanging around with a couple different motorcycle clubs. The day would come when I was invited to join, and I spent about a decade deeply immersed in the hardcore lifestyle that comes with riding with an old school motorcycle club. But there wasn't enough time in the saddle to offset the bars, the violence, or the politics of club live, and eventually I realized it just wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I wanted to travel, without an end date or obligations, and needed to be independent and self-reliant while doing it. So in the spring of I bought a truck and a toy hauler, loaded up the motorcycle, and set out on the adventure of a lifetime! I've since upgraded the all 3 of those vehicles and there's no end in sight to my wandering. I plan to explore, adventure, collect as many memories as I can, and to meet as many new people along the way as possible. I am a nomad without bounds, and I intend to squeeze every drop of excitement out of the time I have on this earth! </p>
<p>Keep the shiny side up! </p>
