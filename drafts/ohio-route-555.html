Fink's also hosts a variety of events throughout the year, from charity rides to bike nights with live music.</p>

<p>But perhaps the best part of the ride is the chance to see Ohio's natural beauty up close. From rolling hills to lush forests, there's no shortage of stunning scenery along the Triple Nickel. Keep your eyes peeled for wildlife too - you might spot deer, wild turkeys, or even a black bear if you're lucky.</p>
